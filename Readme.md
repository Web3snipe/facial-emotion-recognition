Facial Emotion Recognition using face-api.js
Overview

This project implements Facial Emotion Recognition using face-api.js, a JavaScript library built on TensorFlow.js. Users can either upload an image or use their webcam to detect facial expressions directly in the browser. The detected emotions are displayed on the HTML canvas in real-time.

The project is simple and runs entirely in the browser, with no need for backend services or model training. Models are fetched from face-api.js's online repository, making it lightweight and easy to set up.
Features

    Real-Time Emotion Detection: Recognizes emotions using a webcam stream or uploaded images.
    Face Detection: Detects faces in the browser and overlays emotion labels.
    Multiple Emotions Supported: Detects happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutral expressions.
    Client-Side Processing: No server needed; runs entirely on the client-side using JavaScript.

Installation
Prerequisites

    A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
    Basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and face-api.js.

Steps to Run Locally

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-emotion-recognition-face-api.git
    cd facial-emotion-recognition-face-api

    Open index.html in a browser: Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to start using the application.

    Internet connection required: The project fetches pre-trained models from GitHub. Ensure you have an active internet connection when running the application.

Usage
Upload an Image for Emotion Detection

    On the webpage, click the "Upload Image" button.
    Select an image that contains a face.
    The system will detect the face and display the predicted emotions on the image canvas.

Real-Time Webcam Emotion Detection

    Click the "Start Webcam" button.
    Grant permission to access your webcam.
    The system will detect your face in real-time and display the emotions on the canvas overlay.

Supported Emotions

The system can classify and display the following emotions:

    Happy üòÄ
    Sad üò¢
    Angry üò°
    Surprised üòÆ
    Neutral üòê

How It Works

This application uses face-api.js to load pre-trained models for facial detection and emotion recognition. The following steps outline the main functionality:

    Face Detection: face-api.js detects faces in the uploaded image or webcam stream.
    Expression Analysis: The facial expression recognition model analyzes detected faces and classifies them into one of several emotion categories.
    Visualization: The detected emotions are overlaid onto the image or video stream using an HTML canvas.

Key Functions in JavaScript (main.js):

    Model Loading:

    javascript

    faceapi.nets.tinyFaceDetector.loadFromUri('/models'),
    faceapi.nets.faceExpressionNet.loadFromUri('/models')

    Models for face detection and emotion recognition are loaded from a public GitHub repository.

    Image Upload: When an image is uploaded, the face is detected, and the emotion is analyzed and displayed on the canvas.

    Webcam Stream: The webcam feed is processed frame-by-frame to detect facial expressions in real-time.

index.html

This is the main entry point for the project. It contains buttons to start the webcam or upload images, and renders the HTML canvas for displaying emotions.
main.js

Handles the logic for loading models, detecting faces, and classifying emotions. It also contains functions to capture the webcam feed or uploaded image, process it, and update the HTML canvas with emotion predictions.

javascript

// Load face-api models from GitHub
Promise.all([
  faceapi.nets.tinyFaceDetector.loadFromUri('/models'),
  faceapi.nets.faceExpressionNet.loadFromUri('/models')
]).then(enableInteraction);

// Functionality for webcam or image-based emotion recognition...

styles.css

(Optional) You can customize the appearance of the page by updating the CSS file.
Technologies Used
